Return the root node of a binary search tree that matches the given preorder traversal.


It's guaranteed that for the given test cases there is always possible to find a binary search tree with the given requirements.

Input: [8,5,1,7,10,12]

Output: [8,5,10,1,7,null,12]

Constraints:

1 <= preorder.length <= 100

1 <= preorder[i] <= 10^8

The values of preorder are distinct.
