# Problem Statement

Given a string S, consider all duplicated substrings: (contiguous) substrings of S that occur 2 or more times.  
(The occurrences may overlap.)

Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length.  
(If S does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is "".)
