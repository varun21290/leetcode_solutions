# Problem Statement

We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).


(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)


You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)

Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2

Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]

(The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)
